Test01
This test tries to generate a few functions to do basic maths operations.
CoPilot can give the codes for simple ones or relatively less simple one such as IsPrime and Factorial.
But CoPilot cannot give the codes for NextNumber function which is not very straightforward.

Suggestions can be varied depending on the language
Test01 of C# and Python are not the same - where the implementation just follows the suggestion code until trying with the complicated function NextNumber
